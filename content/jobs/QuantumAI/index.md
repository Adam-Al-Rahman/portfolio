- Quantum AI is the use of Quantum computing for the computation of machine learning algorithms.
- Due to the computational advantage of quantum computing, quantum AI can help achieve results that are not possible to achieve with classical computers.
- Quantum computing and artificial intelligence are both transformational technologies and artificial intelligence are likely to require quantum computing to achieve significant progress.
