- All the genetic detail are encoded in the Dnas of living organisms.
- Could we also used it to store digital data like image, documents and etc.
  - The answer is my friend, YES.
- Theoretically we can save 1 Zetabytes of data per gram of DNA.
- Currently we can only save 215 petabytes per gram.
- Synthetic Dna is read using `DNA Sequenser`. And if any error occurs it is corrected by `Error-Correcting Code`.
- Down side of Dna-Storage is that `Synthesizing Dnas` cost arround $3500/MB  (megabyte).
